# Wrapped SQL playground 🎠🎧

So, I'm a big fan of Spotify, and I love seeing my yearly Wrapped playlists. I also needed to practice my SQL skills, so why not combine the two? By doing this, I'm able to find super cool insights in my own music taste while becoming better at writing smart and efficient querys.

I have used [exportify](https://exportify.net/) to export all wrapped playlists from 2015-2023 into csv files, that I've then imported into my postgres database. 

This is a work in progress and I'm simply trying out different things to see if I can find any cool patterns in my own data! 

Also, I'm also using pandas to modify my csv files whenever I need to! Very handy.
